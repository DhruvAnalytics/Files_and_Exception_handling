It keeps our data safe in threads and avoids memory overload in processes.\n",

        "      - Reference counting : Python keeps track of how many references (or \"links\") there are to an object. When we create a new variable or assign something, the reference count goes up. When the references go away (like if a variable is deleted), the count goes down.\n",
        "      - Automatic deletion : When an object's reference count drops to zero - meaning nothing is using it anymore - Python deletes it automatically to free up memory.\n",
        "      - Cyclic garbage collection : Sometimes, objects reference each other in a loop (a cycle), so even if nothing else is using them, their reference count never drops to zero. Python's garbage collector is smart enough to detect these cycles and clean them up too, using a separate algorithm that runs occasionally in the background."

        "  - Multithreading is important because it allows our program to do multiple things at the same time, especially when tasks are waiting around - like for user input, files to load or data to download from the internet.\n",
        "  -  Benefits of multithreading :     \n",
        "      - Better performance for I/O-bound tasks : If our program spends a lot of time waiting (for example, reading files or fetching web pages), multithreading lets other parts of our code run during those waits. This makes our program feel faster and more responsive.\n",
        "      - Improved user experience : In apps with a user interface (like games or desktop apps), multithreading helps keep the app responsive. For example, while one thread handles a long calculation, another keeps the UI from freezing.\n",
        "      - Efficient use of resources : Threads share the same memory space, so switching between them is usually faster and less memory-heavy than using multiple processes."
